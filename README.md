About The App:
React-Analysis-Chart is an app where you can render chart depends on filteration form and render list depend also on the filteration form and when you click on item in chart ,it will go to the datails page to show its details.
I choose react and redux to build the application. I use redux for state management system(SMS). Actions ,reducers and store to help me making the structure easier and make the application easier in controlling .I choose redux-thunk to make the asynchronous operations . I look for package to draw my chart so i use react-chartjs-2
